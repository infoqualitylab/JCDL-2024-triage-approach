As a result, we constructed the more reasonable structure 5 with a dibenzobicyclo[3.2.2]nonane skeleton (Scheme 1). The biosynthesis of 5 could be explained as follows: Goupiolone A (1) is apparently produced by the oxidative condensation between catechol quinone (3 a), derived from catechol (3), and ethyl gallate (4) via a benzobicyclo[3.2.1]octane-type intermediate. Then, intermolecular 1,4-addition between 3 a and 1, intramolecular 1,2-addition of the product, and subsequent reduction of the o-quinone affords 5 (Scheme 2). The experimental NMR data of goupiolone B were very similar to those of the dibenzobicyclo[3.2.2]nonane unit of 6, which is an oxidative condensation product of theaflavin (7) and epicatechin (8) (Scheme 3).11 The structural similarity strongly supported the proposed biosynthetic pathway to 5.11 The validity of structure 5 was confirmed by DFT calculations of the 13C NMR chemical shifts of 2 and 5,10 followed by comparison with the reported data. As shown in Figure 1, the correlation between experimental and calculated data for 2 was very low (R2=0.8318), whereas the calculated data for 5 were in good agreement with the experimental data (R2=0.9980). On the basis of these considerations, we performed the biomimetic synthesis of 5 from 3 and 4 via 1.",n,"Matsuo Y., Yoshida A., Saito Y., Tanaka T.",Structural Revision and Biomimetic Synthesis of GoupioloneB,2017,ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION,"Scopus, Web of Science",

It combines very high resolution with an extremely rich information content about the local properties of atoms in molecules in terms of the geometric as well as electronic structure. The theoretical, quantum mechanical (QM) analysis of NMR experiments and the resulting spectra has a long history.1, 2 With modern linear-response-based quantum-chemistry methods (e.g., density functional theory, DFT), the ab initio computation of the parameters in the NMR spin Hamiltonian, that is, the nuclear magnetic shielding constants (or the chemical shifts δ on a relative scale) and the indirect spin–spin coupling constants (J, SSCCs), has become quite routine3 (for recent mixed DFT/empirical approaches, see Ref. 4). With standard hybrid functional approximations, reasonable accuracies of about 0.1–0.3 ppm (for δ) and 0.5 Hz (for J) can be achieved for these second-order properties of organic molecules.5-8 Although these data can often be directly compared to experiment, until now, no fully automated procedure has been described that computes a properly averaged, fully coupled NMR spectrum entirely by quantum chemistry. To the best of our knowledge, such a composite scheme consisting of four more or less independent steps as illustrated in Figure 1 is proposed here for the first time (for related incomplete attempts, see Refs. 5, 9, and 10). From the very beginning, it was constructed with an eye on robustness and computational feasibility so that natural products with about 100 atoms can be treated and that spectra for systems with 40–70 atoms can be computed within hours on a standard quad-core laptop computer.",n,"Grimme S., Bannwarth C., Dohm S., Hansen A., Pisarek J., Pracht P., Seibert J., Neese F.",Fully Automated Quantum-Chemistry-Based Computation of Spin-Spin-Coupled Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectra,2017,ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION,"Scopus, Web of Science",
2,1,10.1002/anie.201708266,n,n,n,n,n,10,2,10,"The crucial and thus far unsolved problem for the general prediction of NMR spectra is the thermally induced, nuclear permutation (and averaging) already mentioned by Bagno.5 Taking a Boltzmann average of NMR parameters computed for individual conformers, as suggested for example by Willoughby and co-workers,10 is necessary but unfortunately insufficient to model real systems. As shown in Figure 1 (left inset), a thermally accessible ensemble of minimum-energy structures generally consists of conformers as well as rotamers (conformer/rotamer ensemble, CRE). A conformer belongs to a set of stereoisomers, each of which is characterized by a distinct energy minimum.16 Rotamers arise from restricted bond rotation (or other low-barrier motions such as inversion), leading to an interchange of nuclei but to minima with identical energies and NMR parameters. Rotamers contribute substantially to the molecular entropy, and the completeness of an ensemble can be checked by comparing the experimental and theoretical values (see the Supporting Information). Rotamers are of utmost importance here because they represent the rapid nuclei interchange (typically on a sub-picosecond time scale) that leads to an average of NMR parameters on the much slower time scale of the experiment (for very slow, high-barrier (>15–20 kcal mol−1) processes, additive signals for different species, termed “isomers” here, are observed). Not considering rotamers would yield totally wrong simulated spectra, for example, isolated methyl groups would not show single (singlet) signals and an ethyl group would not give rise to the expected simple quartet/triplet splitting (see below). Note that intermediate cases leading to line-broadening effects are not considered, that is, our method works only for very slow and very fast nuclei exchange.",n,"Grimme S., Bannwarth C., Dohm S., Hansen A., Pisarek J., Pracht P., Seibert J., Neese F.",Fully Automated Quantum-Chemistry-Based Computation of Spin-Spin-Coupled Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectra,2017,ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION,"Scopus, Web of Science",

Such occurrences are particularly prevalent in the natural product (NP) arena, where complex atom connectivities and stereochemical complexity abound.2 Considering the extensive time and spectroscopic demands (e.g., NMR, IR, UV-vis, MS, CD) involved in correctly elucidating a novel natural product, the prevalence of misassignments in the literature is perhaps understandable.3 There are now numerous in silico methods to help with structure elucidation by predicting spectra (e.g., NMR,4 ECD5) from chemical structure input or conversely by predicting chemical structure from spectroscopic data (e.g., ACDLabs6). Yet in spite of these new technologies, misassignments continue to appear. X-ray crystallographic analysis in principle enables definitive structural elucidation, but in the NP arena the requisite quantities of material and suitable crystals are not always available, and furthermore misinterpretations are not unprecedented.2a Ultimate proof of proposed structural assignment is often provided via chemical synthesis and spectroscopic comparison of the synthesized material with the natural material,2 although recently developed electron cryo-microscopy methodology could circumvent this requirement in the future.7",n,"Kutateladze A.G., Krenske E.H., Williams C.M.",Reassignments and Corroborations of Oxo-Bridged Natural Products Directed by OSE and DU8+NMR Computation,2019,ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION,"Scopus, Web of Science",

This would normally be considered an inherently bad strategy, but in the case of strychnine, it is reasonable in that most structures examined are not very flexible. The assumption herein is that chemical shift differences associated with conformational changes within the strychnine structure proposals would not change the ultimate conclusions. 2) We did not consider all possible diastereomers of each structure. In principle, this is an even worse strategy. However, because of the multiple condensed ring systems of the various proposed structures for strychnine (Table 1), reasonably unstrained diastereomers are few (except for 2 and the position of the methyl group in several others). While quantum chemical computations for chemical shifts are certainly reliable enough to distinguish among diastereomers,53-57 we plunge ahead here in the spirit of determining connectivity and postponing the determination of relative configuration. The assumption here is that chemical shift differences associated with configuration changes again would not change our conclusions about connectivity within the very complex multiring systems. This is a far less dangerous assumption for 13C NMR shifts than for 1H NMR shifts.54 A test of the validity of this approach was carried out, as described in the following text.",n,"Seeman J.I., Tantillo D.J.",From Decades to Minutes: Steps Toward the Structure of Strychnine 1910-1948 and the Application of Today's Technology,2020,ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION,"Scopus, Web of Science",

If, however, we encounter any close calls—cases where only small deviations between theory and experiment are found—we will put those structures aside for deeper analysis. DFT-predicted 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts, when obtained with an appropriate level of theory, are expected to be accurate enough that deviations between experimental and computed chemical shifts are expected to be approximately 0.2–0.3 ppm or less for 1H NMR, and roughly 5–6 ppm or less for 13C NMR.53-57 We use 0.3 and 6 ppm as minimum values for “large deviations”.",n,"Seeman J.I., Tantillo D.J.",From Decades to Minutes: Steps Toward the Structure of Strychnine 1910-1948 and the Application of Today's Technology,2020,ANGEWANDTE CHEMIE-INTERNATIONAL EDITION,"Scopus, Web of Science",

Can one, using modern quantum chemical theory, rule out a number of structural hypotheses and point with some degree of confidence to the most likely, if not the correct, structure? Myriad examples have now been published using chemical shifts computed with modern theoretical methods (generally density functional theory, DFT) to support or refute structure assignments.53-56 The application of this type of approach to such complex molecules only became feasible in recent decades, due in large part to the continued development of DFT methods. Herein we apply an expedient approach to explore how such technology could be used to rapidly rule out many quickly proposed or perhaps simply brainstormed structures. While coupling constants also could have been computed, 2D NMR methods applied and analyzed, and so on, we demonstrate here that doing so is not essential for the strychnine problem.

Moreover, considering our recent results assessing that proton is more discriminating than carbon in the assignment of the relative configuration of natural products,17 we have considered the average |Δδ| values of the MAE values of the protons. In particular, the graphical representation of the errors in calculated chemical shifts shown in Figure 3 suggest that 5 b is the best match with the experimental data for every proton with the one exception of the proton at C-17. In conclusion, considering the data reported above, both the MAE values forward to 5 b; as a consequence, we propose that diastereoisomer 5 b is the correct structure for 5.

All optimized structures were verified as ground-state minima by performing frequency calculations at the same level of theory (no imaginary frequencies were found). For NMR calculations, the energies and optimal geometries of 11a–c were first determined at a higher level of theory, using the two-layer ONIOM [M06-2X/6- 31+G(d,p):HF/3-21G] approach and implicit solvation in CHCl3 (IEFPCM; integral equation formalism variant of the polarizable con- tinuum model), as implemented in Gaussian 09 software package (Revision A.02)[10] (Tables S4–S6 in SI). Solute cavities were con- structed using default united-atom radii (UA0). A pruned (99,590) integration grid (99 radial shells and 590 angular points per shell; “ultrafine” grid in Gaussian 09) was employed. All optimized struc- tures were verified as ground-state minima by performing fre- quency calculations at the same level of theory (no imaginary fre- quencies were found), the data from which were also used to com- pute their Boltzmann distribution at 298 K. All optimized structures were then used for NMR calculations. NMR shielding tensors (σ, in ppm) were computed with the gauge-independent atomic orbitals (GIAO) method at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory, includ- ing chloroform solvation effects (using the IEFPCM solvation model), while employing solute cavities built from Bondi radii as implemented in Gaussian 09. A pruned (99,590) integration grid was employed. The computed isotropic magnetic shielding tensors (σiso, in ppm) for each nucleus in all conformers was converted to referenced and empirically scaled chemical shifts (δscaled, in ppm) by applying scaling and referencing factors (slope and intercept, respectively) according to the equation: δscaled = (σiso – intercept)/ slope, where δscaled is the referenced/scaled chemical shift (in ppm), and σiso is the isotropic computed NMR shielding tensor (in ppm). The slope and intercept values are typically obtained by linear re- gression analysis of a plot of the calculated isotropic magnetic shielding tensors (σiso) against the corresponding experimental chemical shifts (δexpt). In the present study, we used generic-scaling factors obtained from large datasets [i.e. obtained from linear re- gression analysis of a plot of calculated isotropic magnetic shielding tensors (σiso) against experimental chemical shifts (δexpt) of a large series of compounds]; these scaling/referencing factors are specific of the level of theory used. For the level of theory used herein [B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)//M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p)] the following values have been calculated by Willoughby et al.:[16] for 1H: intercept = 31.9477, slope = –1.0767; for 13C: intercept = 181.2412, slope = –1.0522. The final calculated chemical shift values (δcalcd, in ppm; Table 2) were determined by Boltzmann averaging the scaled chem- ical shift values (δscaled, in ppm), based on the calculated Gibbs free energy values of each conformer. Specifically, by using the free energy data (kcal mol–1) obtained from the frequency calculations, a Boltzmann weighting factor [e(–E/RT), where E is the relative energy (kcal mol–1) with respect to the most stable conformer, T is the tem- perature (in K), and R is the gas constant (0.001986 kcal mol–1 K–1)] was determined for each conformer at 298 K, which was, in turn, converted into the relative mole fraction by dividing the calculated Boltzmann factor of each conformer by the sum of all the Boltz- mann factors of all contributing conformers. The resulting weight- ing factors (mole fraction contributions) were applied to the scaled chemical shift values (δscaled, in ppm) for each nucleus of each indi- vidual conformer. Summation of the weighted chemical shifts across all conformers generates the final Boltzmann-weighted aver- age chemical shifts (δcalcd, in ppm) used to compare against experi- mental data (δexpt, in ppm; Table 2).

This topic has been extensively reviewed at different levels of sophistication and with reference to various fields of application.[1–14] For computa- tional purposes, the species are generally considered as isolated within a void (in vacuo, often referred to as ‘the gas phase’). This has the advantage of requiring less computer time than any other QM approach and, moreover, of producing results directly relevant to gas phase spectroscopic studies. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra, however, are most often measured in solution, and the nature of the solvent can have a considerable effect on the ap- pearance of the spectrum, particularly on the shifts.[15] Solvation has been considered as the fifth dimension, coming after the four dimensions of space and time.[16] For this reason, the treatment of solvation is all-important in the computation of NMR spectra. The standard practice of placing the molecule in a polarizable di- electric continuum[17–22] accounts only for long-range electrostatic effects. More elaborate approaches, based on the inclusion of ex- plicit solvent molecules and/or clusters and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, have therefore been developed in order to han- dle short-range effects, notably hydrogen bonding, which are not reproduced by a continuum.[23–38] Because it is relatively easy to handle a large number of small molecules, many MD studies have been devoted to water as a solvent,[25,29–32,34,36,38] gas or liquid.[24,26,27] Other approaches include hybrid QM/molecular mechanics[24,28,39] and QM/Monte Carlo[40] calculations, the incor- poration of the hydrogen nuclear quantum effect by a multicompo- nent scheme,[41,42] and the optimization of functionals and basis set parameters by multivariate techniques.[39,43] Departures from polar- izable continuum model (PCM) results for the 1H and 13C shifts of cyclic ketones in a large number of solvents have been analysed in terms of solvatochromic parameters.[44] Finally, in keeping with the generally accepted practice of refining computational results by means of linear (or nonlinear) scaling, multi-standard ap- proaches and fragment referencing,[8,45–55] scaling factors have been proposed for common NMR solvents.[56]",y,Lomas J.S.,H-1 NMR spectra of alcohols in hydrogen bonding solvents: DFT/GIAO calculations of chemical shifts,2016,MAGNETIC RESONANCE IN CHEMISTRY,"Scopus, Web of Science",

Unfortunately, these methods are usually applicable exclusively to small model molecules but not for real problems.[10] Despite being less accurate, DFT methods, on the contrary, can handle structures composed of several hundreds of atoms.[11] However, the reliability of DFT computations is far lower than of ab initio theories because the error distribution for the existing functionals is not obvious. For example, it was demonstrated that the inclusion of vibrational corrections for DFT methods tends to worsen the agreement with experimental values, which contrasts the behavior of the coupled- cluster methods.[10] For this reason, several extensive benchmarks were published in the last decade.[10,12–17]",y,Chamkin A.A.,BenchmarkingDFTCalculations of(1)Hand(13)CChemical Shifts in Monosubstituted Ferrocenes,2021,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF QUANTUM CHEMISTRY,"Scopus, Web of Science",

Theoretical work is more concerned with establishing the foundations, scope, and limitations of quantum methods (DFT or other- wise) against very small model compounds—indeed, this type of work may even dispense with experi- mental data, but rather uses the convergence with respect to computational limitations, such as basis set size and higher-level theoretical methods, as a bench- marking criterion. Computational work carried out by experimentalists is aimed at ‘real-life’ (as opposed to ‘fundamental/model’) problems, and draws on exist- ing methods to apply them to generally more complex cases. A certain degree of ‘black box’ experience is therefore assumed, in the same sense that one uses NMR spectrometers without knowing the inner work- ings of radiofrequency synthesizers and digital signal processing. However, the results need to be evaluated in more complex ways, as we shall see later. To date, a wide variety (albeit mostly based on DFT) of quan- tum chemical methods has been adopted in this con- text; therefore, we will not attempt any classification or critique thereof, nor review software packages.

NMR is an important and widely used technique for metabolomics and pharmacometabolomics in its own right; its strengths, limitations, and applications are thoroughly described in the literature (Emwas et al. 2019) and in other chapters of this book. In the context of compound identification, NMR is a touchstone method for the fields of synthetic chemistry, natural products chemistry, and drug development. For a pure sample of a small molecule compound analyzed in a modern high-field instrument using 1H and 13C NMR, it is typically possible to assign a definitive structure via computational modeling and/or manual interpretation (Willoughby et al. 2014). The primary challenge associated with applying the NMR to compound identification in metabolomics is its sensitivity. For higher-concentration compounds, NMR is effective at both quantification and identification, and detailed guides describing compound identification strategies in NMR metabolomics have been written (Dona et al. 2016). However, compounds present at lower concentrations (mid-low micromolar and below) are not amenable to identification without purification and concentration. Techniques to purify unknowns using chromatographic fractionation have been devised (van der Laan et al. 2021; Whiley et al. 2019) but are still not practical for lower-abundance features. While scale-up to semi-preparative or preparative chromatography or other refinements are possible, it remains challenging to obtain high-quality NMR spectra of a substantial portion of features detectable by mass spectrometry.",n,"Hissong R., Evans K.R., Evans C.R.",Compound Identification Strategies in Mass Spectrometry-Based Metabolomics and Pharmacometabolomics,2023,Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology,Scopus,

All organic compounds have internal bond rotation degrees of freedom which tend to various conformations differing in the dihedral angles of those rotatable bonds.

The ability of a molecule to change its conformation under the influence of intermolecular interactions is a fundamental property of many biologically active, especially nitrogen-containing, compounds and is the basis of their functioning [11]. Experimental study of these changes using physicochemical methods faces methodological difficulties related to the fact that energetically disfavored conformers [12–15], which are not detected in experiment but may be biologically significant, are neglected. Therefore, in some cases application of efficient, modern methods of computational chemistry is the only way to get such information. But even when experimental data are sufficiently complete, these calculations could give very useful information for their interpretation. Density functional theory (DFT) is widely used for molecule conformation analysis due to its low computational complexity (compared with post-Hartree–Fock methods) and good results in comparative analysis of a series of similar molecules. It is one of the most attractive methods for predicting NMR shifts and coupling constants of organic molecules [16, 17].

(2014) to provide nonspecialists with a useful tool for validating putative structural assignments. However, experimentally acquired 1H and/or 13C NMR spectral data and its proper interpretation for the compound of interest is required as a starting point. Their approach described the following steps: (i) using molecular mechanics (MM) calculations (with, e.g., the modelling package MacroModel) to generate a library of conformers (usually within 50 Kcal of the ground state); (ii) using DFT calculations (with, e.g., Gaussian 09) to determine the optimal low energy geometry (rather than a saddle point), free energies, and chemical shifts for each conformer; (iii) determining Boltzmann-weighted 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts; and (iv) comparing the computed chemical shifts for two (or more) candidate structures with the experimentally determined data to determine the best fit. The authors suggest that for a typical structure assignment of a small organic molecule (e.g., fewer than around 10 non-H atoms or up to about 180 a.m.u. and ∼ 20 conformers), this protocol could be completed in approximately 2 h of active effort over a 2-day period. For more complex molecules, including natural products (e.g., fewer than ∼ 30 non-H atoms or up to ∼ 500 a.m.u. and ∼ 50 conformers), the protocol could require around 3–6 h of active effort over a 2-week period.

However, complicated systems often generate challenging chemical shift attribution.(Schlegel et al., 2002; Porco et al., 2006; Saielli and Bagno, 2009) Recent developments of computational quantum chemistry methods have highly improved the confidence in structural assignment. This marriage between experimental and theoretically predicted NMR spectra spread over for successful characterization and elucidation of new synthetic and natural chemical compounds. (Aliev et al., 2009) Nowadays, there are many calculation software allowing (even non-experts in theoretical chemistry) to perform reliable predictions on chemical shifts and coupling constants. Orca (Neese, 2012), Gamess (Schmidt et al., 1993) Dalton (Aidas et al., 2014), NWChem (Valiev et al., 2010), ADF (Velde et al., 2001), ReSpect (Malkin et al., 2012) and Gaussian (Frisch et al., 2016) (that was used in this work) are just a few of a long list. Commonly, the most investigated nuclei in routine calculations are 1H (Lomas, 2014) and 13C (Tulyabaev and Khalilov, 2011), however recent research in the field has accomplished excellent quality results even on heteronuclei such as 15N (Samultsev et al., 2014) and 31P (Fedorov et al., 2014). The theoretical aim consists in calculating the molecular second-order magnetic response properties, such as nuclear magnetic shielding tensor. In these terms the most commonly used approaches are: the IGLO (Kutzelnigg et al., 1991) (Individual Gauge for Localized Orbital), the IGAIM (Keith and Bader, 1992) (Individual Gauges for Atoms In Molecules), the CSGT(Keith and Bader, 1993) (Continuous Set of Gauge Transformation) and the GIAO (Wolinski et al., 1990) (Gauge Including Atomic Orbital). The last approach turned out to be the most popular because it is more precise in the convergence of the shielding tensor with respect to the size of the basis set (Yasiltepe et al., 2018). Frequently, calculations of NMR chemical shift involve a single point energy on a fixed conformation, it is clear that NMR experimental spectra depends on several conformations, from the computational point of view this feature is improved by performing a Boltzmann process with respect to the energies of all conformers.(Willoughby et al., 2014) The most popular quantum mechanical methods for NMR simulation are: HF(Roothaan, 1951) (Hartree Fock ab-initio method), higher-level post Hartree Fock method including electron correlation such as MP2 (Møller and Plesset, 1934) (Moller-Plesset theory), DFT(Hohenberg and Kohn, 1964) (density functional theory). DFT methods have become well known in the last years thanks to the possibility of being able to access a wide range of functional forms and the excellent compromise between accuracy and CPU time demand. The physical observable provided by calculation programs is the isotropic shielding tensor which has to be converted in to the experimentally observable chemical shift (c.s.). It can be accomplished by mean of two methods: 1) Using a reference compound (Lodewyk et al., 2012) (usually TMS, that is the experimental calibration standard for 1H and 13C NMR) and modelling both reference and target compound with the same method, the equation for the conversion is the following; δt = σr + δr - σt (where δt and δr are the chemical shifts of the target molecule and of the reference, respectively, while σt and σr are the corresponding isotropic magnetic shielding values). This is the simpler but less accurate method. 2) Carrying out a linear regression, (Pierens, 2014) in this method many isotropic shielding values belonging to several reference compounds are plotted against their experimental chemical shifts. The intercept and slope of the best fitting are used to transform isotropic magnetic shielding values into a chemical shifts according to the following equation: δ = (σ – intercept) / (-slope)",y,"Bella G., Rotondo A.",Theoretical prediction of C-13 NMR spectrum of mixed triglycerides by mean of GIAO calculations to improve vegetable oils analysis,2020,CHEMISTRY AND PHYSICS OF LIPIDS,"Scopus, Web of Science",

The NOE data indicated the same relative configurations regarding rings A and B of both compounds. However, the chemical shift of the methyl carbon C-18 (δC 11.8) was deshielded in comparison with that of 21 (δC 7.3) and other 17R homologues. This finding suggested the configurational distinction in the γ-lactone ring. The NOE correlation between H3-18 (δH 1.47, s) and H-7 (δH 4.53) (Fig. S2) rather than the correlation between H-17 and H-7 as the case of 21 suggested that 2 was a 17-epimer of praelolide. Based on the DP4+ computation, the 13C NMR chemical shifts of 21 and its 17-epimer were calculated. Generation of conformers using automatic sampling tools was based on the molecular mechanics with the Merck Molecular Force Field (MMFF) in Spartan. The GIAO NMR chemical shifts of 21 and its 17-epimer (2) were calculated under Gas Phase/mPW1PW91/6-311 + G(d,p) conditions [31].

This is also observed for the absolute error, given that the error for the incorrectly matched pair B is approximately 1.6 times bigger for both cases. This trend is reversed for the correlations made from 13C chemical shifts, as the MAE and absolute error for the substructures of group B are that 13C calculated chemical shifts from this level of theory is not useful for a clear distinction between stereoisomers and being so, one can safely assume that the 1H analysis is more relevant for this study [49,50].

Multiple confor- mations are responsible for the currently observed low-frequency bump-like Raman spectra because of the flexible tail chain (Katsoulidis et al., 2019). To fit these bumps and seek possible optimal conformations, we searched for the conformational energy landscape as functions of the dihedral angles q and 4 using the DFT B3LYP method (see STAR Methods) (Wang et al., 2019). We determined core conformations and meta- stable states at basins over the energy landscape as the most possible structures. To ensure a full descrip- tion of all low-energy conformers, the conformational spaces of histamine corresponding with accurate es- timates of energy were explored by considering all possible combinations of various torsional degrees of the C2-C3 and C3-C4 bonds. The 3D presentations of the energy landscapes are shown in Figure 2B for the three different pH histamine solutions. Three energy minima in each landscape were selected as three sta- ble states of the histamine molecule in each pH solution. We calculated the local nucleophilicity and elec- trophilicity of these minimum energy conformations by orbital-weighted Fukui functions (Figure 2C; Felten et al., 2015) and found that the surrounding of N8 is nucleophilic (bluer) in the neutral/monocation forms and electrophilic (greener) in the dication form. This indicates that the neutral/monocation forms are more likely to form intramolecular hydrogen bonds to bend the internal side chain than the dication form. Based on the molecular conformation of each stable state with the minimum energy, we calculated the corresponding Raman spectra and found that each conformation is associated with three Raman peaks in the low-frequency side and the highest intensity peak appears at the lowest wavenumber end associated with the torsion of the C3-C4 bond (Figure 2A). Least-squares analysis was used to quantitatively determine the relative ratios of the three minimal energy conformations (Willoughby et al., 2014). According to the ratios, we can get simulations via linear superimposing of the calculated Raman spectra of each conforma- tion.

The first is the evaluation of the structural model parameters. The agreement between the model and the physical and chemical structure parameters of the real structure is commonly used to judge the model’s accuracy, including elemental composition, carbon aromaticity, molecular weight distribution, density, pore size distribution, and radial distribution function (RDF) [67], [69], [74], [76], [103], [133], [151]. In addition, infrared and 13C NMR spectra for evaluating the coal molecular structure are also commonly used with the help of the density functional theory (DFT) method and the 13C NMR chemical shift calculation method [68], [76], [118], [173], [181], [182], [183]. The combination of these pieces of parameter information can serve, to a degree, as a means to verify consistency and provide a multiperspective assessment for obtaining a reasonable coal model. For example, Niekerk et al. [103] performed a preliminary validation of the structure based on the molecular weight distribution obtained by LDTOF-MS, which was compared with the molecular weight distribution of the model calculated using the developed Perl script. Furthermore, the main characteristics of the two coal models (the vitrinite-rich coal and inertite-rich coal models) were summarized (e.g., the inertite-rich coal model, atomic H/C ratio, aromaticity, and helium density), and the results corresponded with the experimental data. Lu et al. [155] constructed an initial 2D molecular structure. The rationality of the proposed 2D model was evaluated using the agreement between the line shapes of the calculated and experimental 13C NMR spectra, and then by comparing the coincidence of the system model density.

[69] compared parameters, such as H/C ratio, heteroatom (O, N, S) content, stacking, curvature, and pore size distribution between model and experimental data, respectively, in the process of validating the model.

The conformers were subjected to Boltzmann weighting and then converted to empirically-scaled chemical shift values for each nucleus of the candidate structure. Regression analysis parameters by Lodewyk et al. [37] were used to scale and reference 1H and 13C chemical shifts. These operations were repeated for each of the four di- astereoisomers. The NMR and free-energy data were assembled by using the python script created by Willoughby et al. [38]. The experimental data set were compared with the calculated data and mean absolute error values were determined.",n,"Resende G.C., Alvarenga E.S., Willoughby P.H.",Isolation and stereochemical assignment of phthalides resulting from the Diels-Alder reaction between 5-isopropoxyfuran-2(5H)-one and cyclopentadiene,2015,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE,"Scopus, Web of Science",
81,80,10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.05.139,n,n,n,n,,16,1,[16],"Interestingly, in the case of the isolation and characterization of aurantoside G [6] neither the source nor the isolated compound are available any more. In this case which in our opinion could be quite common, a molecule existed for which a formula was proposed, and the proof of its existence can be given by its total synthesis according to the published formula and subsequent comparison of the experimental structural data. In addition, computational chemistry allows sufficiently accurate predictions of experimental spectroscopic data [16], rendering it possible to complement and/or substitute synthesis. However, the fundamental sine qua non condition for both approaches is the comparison with ALL com- pounds that could reasonably represent the initially isolated molecule. In this regard, the claim of Petermichl et al. (2016) [12] to have synthesized aurantoside G while referring to the proposed formula of Ratnayke et al. (2005) [6] is incorrect as long as not a comparison of the structural data of all reasonably possible mole- cules has been performed, using synthesis and/or computational chemistry. This problem was encountered by the same group in the synthesis of epicoccamide D for which only two diastereomers were prepared and compared to the original natural product [17]. Taking further into account that small differences in chemical shifts and specific optical rotations exist, the claim to have synthesized the originally isolated compound represented by the published formula [18] is again not justified. As an example, the non- synthesized diastereomer (5R,7R)-1d could have similar 13C chemical shifts and a similar specific optical rotation compared to the synthesized diastereomer (5S,7S)-1d (Table 2 in Ref. [17]) leading to an ambiguous assignment. In addition, the chemical shifts were measured in CDCl3 for the naturally occurring com- pound [18], whereas the synthetic compound was measured in methanol-d4. Since it is known that the NMR spectra of 2-acylated tetramic acid derivatives are highly solvent dependent (e.g. har- zianic acid: 13C chemical shift differences of 2 ppm in met-d4 compared to CDCl3) [19] it is not justified to base the diastereomeric discrimination on the comparison of NMR resonances obtained in two different solvents. In addition, a closer look at the resonances revealed that differences in 13C chemical shifts of more than 1 ppm between natural and synthetic product occur (e.g. C1, C3) which are much larger than the differences used for diastereomeric discrim- ination (largest difference of 0.7 ppm) [17].",y,"Reinscheid F., Reinscheid U.M.",Assignment of the absolute configuration of aurantoside G and J,2017,JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR STRUCTURE,"Scopus, Web of Science",
82,81,10.1016/j.molstruc.2017.09.058,n,n,n,n,,50,10,[46e50],"Concerning NMR spectroscopy, the theoretical gauge-invariant atomic orbital (GIAO) method [35,36] has been used with DFT/ B3LYP to compute chemical shifts of organic molecules, comparing them with experimental spectra in order to elucidate molecular structures [18,19,21,27,37e45]. Employing basis sets dependent on explicit external magnetic fields, GIAO is the most reliable and widely used method to compute nuclear magnetic shielding ten- sors [46e50]. Accordingly, the DFT/B3LYP theory has been assessed as accurate with a low computational cost in line with bench- marking studies of basis sets commonly used for prediction of 13C NMR chemical shifts, varying the levels of sophistication [18,19]. As a molecule assumes two or more conformations in solution and at room temperature, each peak of the NMR spectrum represents a weighted average of the respective resonances from each one [20]. Thus, the experimental chemical shifts of a chemical species correspond to average values of a set of conformations [49]. In this sense, comparisons between experimental and theoretical values of the NMR spectra can assist the elucidation of the most stable conformation for each oxime. Therefore, in this work, an investi- gation of the 7 quaternary oximes (4-PAM and the series 1a-c and 3a-c in Fig. 1) and the 7 non-quaternary ones (series 2a-d and 5a-c in Fig. 1) synthesized by Koning and co-workers [10,13] was done by conformational analysis prior to geometry optimization using DFT/ B3LYP theory in a continuum solvation model.

As recommended in the literature, DFT geometry optimizations for 1 and 2 were performed before shielding calculation [30] (also to correct the H positions), while for 3ao, the optimized model is already obtained during solution/refinement procedure. Calculated shieldings (σ) vary in range of ∼150 ppm (Table 3), just as the measured shifts (δ), as they should because these quantities are related by the following relation [31]:(1)where σref is the shielding of 13C nuclei in the reference compound (TMS). In Table 3, carbon atoms are ordered by increasing value of the calculated σ; according to equation (1) this ordering should correspond to the decreasing values of δ. Mutual differences in δexp between neighbouring peaks are taken to be in accordance with the differences in shielding predictions and such approach is used as a help for the assignments of peaks in experimental CPMAS and CPNQS spectra (signals arising from C–H aromatic carbon atoms are excluded due to multiple overlap). This assignment of NMR signals is tentative, but ensures the best linear regression among calculated shieldings and measured chemical shifts. Linear regression calculation gave scaling parameters A [-0.960(2)] and B [165.4(2)] for equation (1), see Fig. 11. Determination of the scaling parameters avoids the obligation of 13C shielding calculation for the reference nuclei (TMS) in order to compare calculated and experimental chemical shifts and their usage is recommended in the literature [32]. Calculated 13C NMR shifts (δcalc) obtained by this scaling parameters and GIPAW predicted shieldings are in very good agreement with δexp and the difference never exceed 2.5 ppm for all assigned carbon atoms in all compounds (Table 3).

Two isobutyryloxy groups were confirmed with the signals at δH 2.61 (2H, m), and 1.21–1.18 (12H, m); the location of these groups at C-12 and C-15 was determined through its HMBC spectrum with the correlations observed between the protons at CH2 -12at δH 3.99 (1H, d, J=11.2Hz) and 4.08 (1H, d, J=11.2Hz) and the signal at δC 177.4 C-1′ (detected by HMBC), and CH2-15 at δH 4.40 (1H, d, J=12.0Hz) and 5.01 (1H, d, J=12.0Hz) and the signal at δC 177.7 C-1′′ (detected by HMBC). The stereochemistry of the C-9 and C-10 double bond was determined to be E by considering the coupling constant (J9,10 = 15.0 Hz). The partial relative configuration of 2 was deduced from a cross peak between H-4 and H-6 from the ROESY ex- periment, helping to place these protons on the same face. However, the presence of the additional stereogenic center at C-11 enabled to de- termine the absolute configuration. The stereochemical properties were depicted using computational quantum mechanical calculations through the comparison of experimental with calculated data. The geometry optimized conformers representing all four possible stereo- isomers were analyzed by applying TDDFT (ECD) and NMR calcula- tions. The experimental and calculated ECD spectra were compared for each stereoisomer. The isomer (4S, 6S, 11R) showed perfect match with the experimental data (Fig. 5). The ECD spectra displayed a prominent negative Cotton effect at ∼210 nm. The NMR tensors were obtained by calculating the GIAO shielding constants of the conformers within 2 kcal/mol of the global minimum. Vibrational analysis was performed to confirm the minima. The DP4 calculations (Smith and Goodman, 2010) were executed at B3LYP/6-311 + G(2d,p) level. The chemical shift (CS) values were calculated according to the guide of the NMR CS assignment of small molecule structures (Willoughby et al., 2014). The DP4 probability analysis of the experimental and calculated CS values supported the ECD results that the (4S, 6S, 11R) was most probable by ∼80.0%. Thus, compound 2 was determined as (4S, 6S, 11R) 4,11- dihydroxy-12,15-diisobutyryloxybisabola-2,7(14),9-triene.",n,"Gogineni V., Nael M.A., Le√≥n F., N√∫√±ez M.J., Cutler S.J.",Computationally aided stereochemical assignment of undescribed bisabolenes from Calea urticifolia,2019,PHYTOCHEMISTRY,"Scopus, Web of Science",

These calculations depend heavily on the availability of experimental isotropic chemical shifts for  and  atoms. Emsley and coworkers have shown that  detection at high frequency MAS (65 kHz) can be used effectively to determine these chemical shifts [206], [207] which can then allow structure determination of powdered samples. These developments have been used in either high frequency MAS or moderate-frequency MAS with homonuclear decoupling to characterise several small molecular systems [208], [209], [210].

At one side, these energy sources cause serious health problems, and at the second side they are not regenerated by natural process. To protect the environmental conditions and solve the issues of continuous regeneration of energy sources as they consumed, scien- tists and researcher communities are trying to develop the alternative ways for obtaining environment friendly green energy sources [2]. These green energy sources may be solar energy [3], wind energy [4], hydropower energy [5] and tidal pools [6] etc. These energy sources can be regenerated at rate equal or large as the amount of their con- sumptions [7]. Sunlight is the great gift of natural source for the people of earth from which we can obtain low cost and environment friendly energy. To convert the sunlight into energy source, scientists developed the photovoltaic devices [8], which could capture the sunlight with the help of their acceptor parts and convert it into the electricity [9]. Basi- cally, photovoltaic solar cell devices contain three fundamental struc- tural units such as donor that donate the electrons toward the acceptor part, which harvests the sunlight with the help of electrons, and spacer units which play a bridging role in linking the donor and ac- ceptor units [10]. Previously, photovoltaics contained the fullerene de- rivatives as electron acceptors. However, large cost of fullerene derivatives motivates scientist to develop the small molecule based or- ganic solar cells (OSCs) [11]. Consequently, the previously developed photovoltaic devices of fullerene derivatives are now completely replaced by non-fullerene acceptors. Compared with the fullerene de- rivative based photovoltaic devices, the modern small OSCs have low manufacturing cost and simple mode of synthesis due to the absence of large structural units [12]. Moreover, fullerene-free OSCs show strong and widely tunable broad bands of absorption in visible region. Now, computational chemistry tools could help the scientists to design new molecules with fullerene-free acceptors and check their different photo- voltaics and opto-electronics properties theoretically prior to their syn- thesis [13]. With this simulation analysis, scientists are now able to study the different efficiency parameters of OSCs without spending large cost and time in the synthesis laboratories for analysis.

An alternative approach is to use chemical shift prediction software. The simplest methods rely on an increment-based approach and are available in software packages such as ChemOffice6 and ACD.7 While the increment techniques are accurate for small molecules, they cannot discern between different conformations and usually cannot effectively discern diastereomers.8 For a more peptide-focused approach, empirical methods trained on proteins can be used. Computational packages such as CAMSHIFT,9 SHIFTX2,10 and SPARTAþ,11 use a se- quence alignment algorithm to generate chemical shifts based on the values collected for known protein structures. However, em- pirical methods have their own disadvantages and are not broadly applicable. As these empirical approaches utilize protein training sets, there will be limited applicability to small peptides, especially ones containing non-proteogenic amino acids or cyclic topologies. Additionally, as the power of the empirical approach is sourced in the statistical averaging, the methodologies fail at discerning dif- ferent conformations and diastereomers of peptides.12 Thus, for proper primary and secondary structure validation and identifica- tion of natural products (e.g., undefined stereochemistry), more refined methods for NMR chemical shift prediction are needed.",y,"Zaretsky S., Hickey J.L., St. Denis M.A., Scully C.C.G., Roughton A.L., Tantillo D.J., Lodewyk M.W., Yudin A.K.",Predicting cyclic peptide chemical shifts using quantum mechanical calculations,2014,TETRAHEDRON,"Scopus, Web of Science",

Being quantum mechanical in nature, they represent an ab initio or first principles approach, although empirical data may be used to improve the accuracy of the final chemical shift values. Nonetheless, the results are much less dependent on database or training set parameters, and the methods can be applied, at least in theory, to any chemical system without fear of biased results. Due to the rigorous confor- mational analysis that this method employs, it can be applied to any cyclic peptide system, no matter how flexible, as long as an ade- quate series of conformers are considered. In the present context, the major advantage of these methods is the ability to handle non- proteogenic amino acids and novel linkers.

Taken together with its 13C NMR and elemental analysis data, the molecular formula of 12 was assigned as C32H30O15. The 1H and 13C NMR spectra of 12 indicated the presence of a pyrogallol ring (B-ring) and two sets of flavan A- and C-rings, which were similar to those of 11. The 13C NMR spectrum revealed the presence of a nonconjugated carbonyl (δC 213.1, C-3‴), a carboxyl (δC 170.4, C-6‴), two quaternary carbons (δC 92.3, C-1‴; δC 85.8, C-4‴), a methine (δC 59.3, C-5‴), and a methylene (δC 44.3, C-2‴) carbon. Furthermore, HMBC correlations (Fig. 4) revealed that the carboxyl group formed an ethyl ester (δH 0.95, 3H, t, CH3; δH 3.72 and 3.82, each 1H, m, CH2). The remaining HMBC correlations of the methine (H-5‴), methylene (H-2‴), and C-ring H-2 and H-2″ protons indicated the presence of a cyclopentanone ring (C-1‴–C-5‴). The degree of unsaturation was calculated to be 18 based on the molecular formula, while the unusual low-field shift of the C-1‴ signal (δC 92.3), which is very similar to that of C-1‴ in 11 (δC 94.4), suggested that there was an ether ring between the C-1‴ and pyrogallol C-3′. Thus, the planar structure of 12 was assigned as shown in Fig. 3. The structural relationship between this product and 11 led us to propose a new mechanism for their generation from dehydrotheasinensin C (5) (Scheme 1).

In contrast, the addition of water to the same oxidized pyrogallol ring followed by decarboxylation afforded an enediol intermediate, and the subsequent oxidation of the enediol produced 11.19 This newly proposed mechanism also suggested that the stereostructures of the C-1‴ and C-5‴ positions in 12 were the same as those of 11.

The computed 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts and the experimental values are shown in the SI (Tables S12−S31). For the Boltzmann averaging of all the unique conformations and NMR chemical shift computation for 1H and 13C, we used the python-based script of Willoughby et al., which was published in 2014.36 Williams et al. in 2019 published an article revealing a “bug” in the Willoughby Scripts when calculating NMR chemical shifts.70 The authors showed that some newer personal computer operating systems may randomly sort the Gaussian optimization/frequency and NMR output files of the original protocol. Such mis-sorting would lead to inaccurate determination of the conformation- ally averaged (i.e., Boltzmann-weighted) shielding tensors. Following this article, in 2020, Willoughby et al. published an Addendum to ensure that the original protocol is (and remains) compatible with all operating systems, and they provided an updated script.71 Before using the original Willoughby script (2014), we validated the script using cis- and trans-3-methylcyclohexanol by the author and confirmed that the scripts work in our hands. We subsequently validated using the new script and obtained identical results with the 2014 script. It is important to realize that scaling parameters obtained from the linear regression method are structure- independent and method-dependent. These values are unique to this specific functional and basis set combination, but they are independent of the structure under study. In other words, scaling parameters can be used for any of unknown metabolite to calculate NMR chemical shifts using the B3LYP/6-311G +(2d, p) //M06-2X/6-31G+ (d, p) method.

SA may give the best precision in a computational model, but its choice does not reflect the underlying physics. For this reason, BW is recommended as it has better precision than LE and is still reflective of known physics. BW is supported in the literature as the current gold standard approach, even for other properties such as NMR chemical shift calculations.41,42,46 In IMS in particular, a molecule does not exist as a single conformer, but rather interconverts between low-energy-barrier conformations rap- idly during flight at room temperature. The final arrival time captured is then a weighted average of these conformers according to their duration of existence. It is reasonable to assume BW is more accurate because this is what is intended to be captured with Boltzmann’s energy and temperature- dependent probability equation. At this time, however, we cannot directly say anything about the accuracy of the techniques with high confidence. Other underlying conditions, such as the ionization site location or tautomer form, can significantly influence conformer formation, changing the CCS versus energy landscape, and thus altering the predicted CCS. Unique tautomers, for instance, can have CCS differences significantly larger than the CCS differences of the conformers for a single tautomer, with CCS of individual conformation populations of two unique tautomers possibly not even overlapping. To achieve optimal accuracy, a wholistic approach needs to be taken, optimizing all aspects that could significantly change conformation simultaneously.

Thus, a single proton signal is observed for the methyl group, and a single 13C signal is observed for the tert-butyl methyl carbons (obviously the central quaternary carbon will have a separate signal). Therefore, when one has such a group in one’s molecule, the “calculated” isotropic shift of the group is the average of the individual isotropic shifts obtained from the NMR calculations.

The structural differences can be found at positions 11 and 12; chemical shifts of C-11 and C-12 indicate a γ-lactone. This is supported by diastereotopic methylene proton signals for H-12 (H-12a δH 4.93, H-12b δH 4.76 ppm) and a HMBC correlation between H-12 and C-11 (Figure 1). Additionally, eight more carbon signals and six olefinic hydrogens were found in the 13C and 1H NMR spectrum, respectively. The additional olefinic hydrogens belong to the same spin system as observed in the COSY spectrum (Figure 1). With HMBC correlations from H- 3′ to C-1′ and H-6′ to C-8′, 2 exhibited an octatrienedioic acid side chain linked through an ester bond. Large coupling constants (3JH2−H3 15.3 Hz; 3JH4−H5 14.9 Hz; 3JH6−H7 15.2 Hz) are indicative of an E configuration for all three double bonds. The NMR data were recorded in MeOH-d4, and therefore, the carboxylic acid proton was not detected in the 1H spectrum and we were unable to detect HMBC correlations connecting the triene moiety to the sesquiterpene core. To support our structural assignment, 2 was methylated in the presence of methyl iodide. Indeed, we were able to detect a new methoxy signal in the 1H NMR spectrum in CDCl3 (δC 51.9 ppm, δH 3.77 ppm) and observed HMBC correlations from H3-9’ to C- 8′, and from H-6 to C-1′, supporting that OH-6 condenses with the acyl side chain (Figure S50, Supporting Information). This is in agreement with previously reported acylated drimane sesquiterpenes.11,14 The relative configuration of 2 was determined by NOE analysis and by comparative analysis of computed NMR chemical shifts to experimental spectra. A trans-fused decalin ring system was supported by NOE correlations between H3-15 and H3-14(ax) with H-2a(ax), H3-15 with H3-14(ax), and H-5 with H-3b(ax) and with H3-13(eq) (Figure 2).

The 1H NMR data matched the literature values for 5R,6R,11R,14R acremodiol, which was generated via total synthesis (Figure S23 and Table S45).6 However, the specific rotation of 4 ([α]D20 +25) was opposite to that of synthesized 5R,6R,11R,14R acremodiol ([α]D20 −35.3);6 both of these values were obtained in CHCl3, and 4 was also analyzed in MeOH so as to compare with those measured for 1−3 (Table S53). These data suggested that compound 4 was the enantiomer of 5R,6R,11R,14R acremodiol and, thus, had an absolute configuration of 5S,6S,11S,14S. This observation was used as a test case for the GIAO NMR calculations (Tables S10−S12) to explore its accuracy for this subgroup of macrolides. In brief, all the minimized conformers of the possible structures were obtained (Figure S26). The NMR shielding constants were calculated from these conformers and converted into chemical shifts (ppm), and the final chemical shift values were calculated (Tables S10−S11 and S21− S28).25,26 The calculated 1H and 13C NMR shifts were scaled empirically (i.e., corrected mean absolute error) to remove system errors (Tables S10 and S11), which has proven to be common practice when working with these calculations.23,24,28 Then, two different NMR calculation methods were used to assess the relative configuration. First, the individual correlation coefficients for each isomer were calculated, followed by the geometric mean of the 1H and 13C NMR correlation coefficients (Table S12).23,24 This gives a correlation coefficient for every possible isomer, and the isomer with a value closest to 1 is considered to be the most likely relative configuration,23 which in this case was either 5S,6S,11S,14S or 5R,6R,11R,14R. Second, DP4+ (combined 1H and 13C) calculations for each isomer were generated (Table S54), which gives the probability for every possible isomer, and the isomer with the highest probability is most likely the relative configuration.38 In this case it was either 5S,6S,11S,14S or 5R,6R,11R,14R. Thus, both calculation methods were in agreement with each other.

The 13C NMR data (Table 1) indicated 14 carbons, including three carbonyl, two vinylic, three oxy- genated, and six aliphatic carbons. The 1H and edited-HSQC NMR data (Table 1) indicated two methyls, two olefinic protons, three methines, and four methylenes. The HMBC correlations from H-10 to C-9 and C-8 and from H-9 to C-10 and C-8, as well as the COSY correlations between H-10 and H-9, indicated a trans (JH3/H2 = 15.8 Hz) α,β-unsaturated ester (Figure 1). This half of the bislactone was formed through a seven-proton spin system (H-9/H-10/H-11/H2-12/H2-13/H- 14/H3-16), as noted via COSY correlations. The other half of the bislactone was formed through HMBC and COSY correlations, focusing on correlations across two spin systems (i.e., H2-3/H2-4 and H-6/H3-15). HMBC correlations from H- 6 and H3-15 to the keto group at C-5 (δC 208.0), and H2-3 and H2-4 to both C-5 and the ester carbonyl at C-2 (δC 171.5), formed the other side of the bislactone. These halves were connected to form the macrolide through the HMBC correlations of H-14 to C-2 and H-6 to C-8 coupled with the obvious oxygenation of H-14 (δH/δC 4.93/71.1) and H-6 (δH/δC 5.41/75.1). To probe the configuration of the stereogenic centers in 1, we first attempted Mosher’s ester analysis,25,26 but unfortunately, no reaction was observed (data not shown). This line of inquiry was abandoned, and instead, NMR calculations were performed. Utilizing the correlation coefficient method, the configuration of 1 was assigned as either 6S,11R,14R or 6R,11S,14S (Table S3). Then, calculation of the optical rotations for these two possibilities were used to distinguish between enantiomers. The specific rotation of 1 agreed in sign with the calculated value for 6R,11S,14S (i.e., [α]D20 +166 vs [α]D20 +51 (c 0.10, MeOH); Table S53). Interestingly, the DP4+ method indicated that the configuration of 1 was either 6R,11R,14R or 6S,11S,14S (Table S54), and again, using the specific rotation data, the configuration was assigned as 6S,11S,14S (Table S53). The benefit of testing both approaches was the confluence of data for the 11S and 14S assignments. However, there was discordance for the 6 position, and thus, this position remains unassigned. Based on biogenetic considerations, a tentative assignment could be 6S, because it was likely biosynthesized in a manner similar to compounds 3 and 4.

All four diastereomers were subjected to NMR calculation with the density functional theory (DFT) at the mPW1PW91/6-311+G(d,p)//m06-2x/6-31G(d) level. The calculated NMR data were examined using the customizable DP4+ methodology developed by Sarotti15 to determine the most probable diastereomer. Among the four diastereomers, 1a showed a 100% DP4+ probability based on 1H and 13C data, but 0.04% probability using the 13C data alone (Table S7). On the other hand, 1b had a 99.96% probability using the 13C data alone but 0% probability based on all data. As was demonstrated by Sarotti et al, all data is important and must be used in DP4+ analysis.16 The DP4+ assignment based on all data would give a confident conclusion compared to that using only 1H or 13C data. This suggested that 1a was the most probable isomer. Recently, Krahn et al. reported the total synthesis of 1b as an intermediate of zelkovamycin (7).6 The reported NMR data of 1b showed distinct differences to those of 1, particularly in the 2- methyl-3-hydroxy-2-aminobutyric acid unit (Tables S3 and S4). Based on the sharp differences of the experimental NMR data, the possibility of 1b could be unambiguously precluded. Then, DP4+ analysis was reperformed with the three possible diastereomers (1a, 1c, and 1d), which showed 100% probability for 1a based on 1H, 13C shifts, and all data (Table S8). Consequently, the 2-methyl-3-hydroxy-2-aminobutyric acid in 1 could be confidently assigned the 32S,34R configuration, i.e., L- α-methyl-threonine (L-α-Me-Thr). Of note, the 32S config- uration in 1 was consistent with those of the previously identified zelkovamycins,6,9 which suggested that the config- uration of C-32 remained unchanged during the biosynthesis of 1.

Different strategies are used by the two methodologies.

It was thus considered whether using another deuterated solvent might result in better proton signal separation and thus decisive NOE information about the orientation of H-9. Gratifyingly, replacement of chloroform-d with methanol-d4 as a solvent alleviated the signal overlap in the 1H NMR spectrum. In particular, the originally overlapping resonances of H-8 and Me-15 were deconvoluted, thereby permitting confirmation of the NOE correlations of H-8 (δH 1.44)/H-11 and H-12 (Figure S15, Supporting Information), which, in turn, allowed the assignment of an α-orientation for H-9 (Figure 3). When all these results were taken together, it was concluded that the correct structure of tuberostemonine O is 1a, i.e., the C-9 epimer of the originally assigned structure 1. To further support this structural revision, DFT-based NMR calculations on 1 and 1a were performed.13 The predicted chemical shifts for 1a were in excellent agreement with the experimental data for tuberostemonine O. The corrected mean absolute deviations (CMADs) were merely 0.08 and 0.88 ppm for 1H and 13C, respectively (Tables S4 and S5, Supporting Information). In contrast, when the predicted shifts of 1 were introduced, increased CMAD values (1H: 0.15 ppm; 13C: 1.81 ppm) were observed (Tables S2 and S3, Supporting Information). The predicted and experimental data were also compared using DP4+ probability analysis,14,15 and all data probabilities of 1a (100%) and 1 (0%) further substantiated the structural revision (Table S6, Supporting Information).",n,"Jiang J.-M., Shi Z.-H., Yang X.-W., Zhu D., Zhao B.-J., Gao Y., Xia D., Yin Z.-Q., Pan K.","Structural Revision of the Stemona Alkaloids Tuberostemonine O, Dehydrocroomines A and B, and Dehydrocroomine",2022,JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS,"Scopus, Web of Science",

There were four possible stereoisomers, (3a′R,8a′R), (3a′R,8a′S), (3a′S,8a′R), and (3a′S,8a′S); however, (3a′R,8a′S)-5 and (3a′S,8a′R)-5 were unlikely due to ring strain imposed by the trans-junction of two five-membered rings. (6) Therefore, the ECD spectra for (3a′S,8a′S)-5 and (3a′R,8a′R)-5 were calculated. Low-energy conformers within 6 kcal/mol were initially obtained by a conformational search using the Monte Carlo method at the MMFF94 force field. The resulting conformers were subsequently optimized at the AM1 level and then reoptimized at the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in MeOH (PCM). The lowest-energy conformers of (3a′S,8a′S)-5 and (3a′R,8a′R)-5 are shown in Figure 2. ECD spectra of the low-energy conformers with Boltzmann populations (>1%) were calculated at the TD-CAM-B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level in MeOH (PCM), and the results were averaged (Figure 3A). (7) The experimental ECD spectrum of 5 showed a positive Cotton effect at 309 nm and negative Cotton effects at 371 and 244 nm. These Cotton effects resembled those of the calculated ECD spectrum of the (3a′S,8a′S)-5 diastereomer. In contrast, the calculated ECD spectrum of the (3a′R,8a′R)-5 diastereomer showed opposite signs of the Cotton effects at these wavelengths. From these data, the configurations of C-3a′ and C-8a′ of 5 were assigned as (3a′S,8a′S). The NMR chemical shifts of (3a′S,8a′S)-5 and (3a′R,8a′R)-5 were also calculated using the gauge-including atomic orbital (GIAO) method at the mPW1PW91/6-311+G(2d,p) level in acetone (PCM) (8) (Tables S5–S8, Supporting Information). The experimental 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts agreed to a much greater extent with the calculated values for (3a′S,8a′S)-5 rather than (3a′R,8a′R)-5 [R2 = 0.9924 (3a′S,8a′S), 0.9828 (3a′R,8a′R) for 1H NMR chemical shifts; R2 = 0.9978 (3a′S,8a′S), 0.9974 (3a′R,8a′R) for 13C NMR chemical shifts] (Figures S10–S12, Tables S9 and S10, Supporting Information). The DP4 probability analysis, (9) which was developed to assign structure by comparing calculated and experimental NMR spectra, was also performed based on the calculated and experimental 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of 5. The DP4 analysis of the two possible structures gave 99.1% probability for the (3a′S,8a′S) structure (Table S11, Supporting Information).

Over recent years, the use of computational modeling has emerged as a supplementary method to determine the arrangements of these molecules, being able to calculate not only NMR chemical shifts6 but also other physical properties such as circular dichroism or infrared data. Nowadays, the 1H and 13C NMR chemical shift values predicted based on DFT calculations7 have provided a remarkable contribution to the study of the relative configuration of new chemical entities, beyond the limits of X-ray and neutron diffraction methods.8 Although this approach has been commonly used in rigid systems and for close stereogenic centers, it becomes particularly challenging when the two stereoarrangements are separated, for instance, by either contiguous methylenes ([CH2]n), methynes [(CH═CH)n], or nonstereogenic quaternary carbons.9 ",n,"Tarazona G., Benedit G., Fern√°ndez R., P√©rez M., Rodr√≠guez J., Jim√©nez C., Cuevas C.",Can Stereoclusters Separated by Two Methylene Groups Be Related by DFT Studies?

Starting from the conformers related to the diastereoisomers featuring both the (10′R) and (10′S) absolute configurations and the M/P atropisomeric forms (1a, 1b, 2a, and 2b, Figure 2), the ECD curves were calculated at the MPW1PW91/6- 31G(d,p) functional/basis set in EtOH (IEFPCM) to reproduce the effect of the solvent.17 Comparison of the experimental and calculated ECD curves of 1 and 2 (Figure 3) showed that the calculated spectra of the (M) atropisomeric forms (1a and 1b) are similar to the experimental ECD of 1. On the other hand, the simulated spectra of atropisomeric forms (P) (2a and 2b) are superimposable to the experimental ECD spectrum of 2, regardless of the relative configuration at C-10′. Therefore, these results suggest that the Cotton effects are not influenced by the 3D arrangement at C-10′, further supporting the hindered rotation of the biaryl bond.

Previous efforts in this area have utilized a variety of organisms, with plants being a major source of antioxidant compounds.1−4 Despite the fact that shellfish waste is a rich source of phenolic antioxidants, there have been relatively few attempts to isolate novel antioxidant natural products from this source.5,6 In 2012, serlyticin-A (1, Figure 1) was identified by Kuo and co-workers as one of the compounds in the Serratia ureilytica culture using squid pen waste as the carbon/nitrogen source, and they demonstrated that it has antioxidative and antiproliferative properties.5 While serlyticin-A certainly has the potential for medicinal and food science applications, we suspect that the reported structure is incorrect for several reasons. First, the structure contains an O−O bond, which, based on the results of our calculations, would be prone to cleavage in solution. Second, the characterization data reported for serlyticin-A, including 1D and 2D Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, UV−vis spectroscopy, and IR spectrosco- py, are consistent with multiple potential structures. For example, 1D and 2D NMR data confirm the presence of an indole moiety but do not necessarily support the assignment of the proposed N−O−O−N substructure. Moreover, the reported mass spectrometry data does not match the exact mass of 1. While select tabulated numerical data were provided in the original report, the actual spectra absent.7 These factors coupled with the lack of X-ray crystallography data contribute to the ambiguity in the assignment of structure 1 to serlyticin- A. While it is an accepted practice to elucidate chemical structures relying on information obtained from NMR, IR, and UV−vis, it is not uncommon for structures to be misassigned, leading to the otherwise unnecessary expenditure of additional resources in correcting them.8−10 Here, we report the use of quantum chemical calculations of NMR chemical shifts11−13 to demonstrate that the original structure of serlyticin-A may have been misassigned, and we provided several plausible alternative structures.",n,"Tsui K.Y., Tombari R.J., Olson D.E., Tantillo D.J.",Reconsidering the Structure of Serlyticin-A,2019,JOURNAL OF NATURAL PRODUCTS,"Scopus, Web of Science",

Regarding the first issue, the B3LYP/6-31G**//MMFF level was used in the original DP4 formulation for providing good results in the NMR shift calculation at low computational cost (mainly avoiding expensive ab initio or DFT treatments for the geometry optimization step). However, from our experience it is rather far from being the most accurate method for NMR calculations, mainly in the prediction of 1H shifts. Despite the fact that a full account for this observation is beyond the scope of this article, two representative examples are given in Figure 1. In these cases, the accuracy of the NMR shift calculations in both conformationally rigid molecules significantly increase when passing from MMFF to B3LYP/6-31G* geometries, as well as computing the shielding tensors at higher levels (for example, PCM/mPW1PW91/6-31+G**). This is of vital importance considering the growing support to the claim that proton data makes the most decisive contribution (i.e., are more effective discriminators than 13C data) in stereochemical assignment.12 The sometimes modest performance of the level of theory employed by Smith and Goodman for the DP4 development can be attributed to the geometry optimization step (MMFF) rather than the method to perform the NMR calculations, as also suggested by other authors.11i,j It is well-known that even small errors in the starting geometry can lead to significant errors in the computed chemical shifts.4b,5 Thus, we considered that computing the NMR shifts at higher levels of theory would afford more accurate predictions and, therefore, more reliable DP4 probabilities.13",n,"Grimblat N., Zanardi M.M., Sarotti A.M.",Beyond DP4: an Improved Probability for the Stereochemical Assignment of Isomeric Compounds using Quantum Chemical Calculations of NMR Shifts,2015,JOURNAL OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY,"Scopus, Web of Science",

In this context, quantum-chemical (QC) methods offer a promising alternative. However, their computational cost is in most cases several orders of magnitude larger and they require the use of high performance computing resources when a large number of predictions is needed. To keep the computational costs manageable, several approximations are usually employed, both regarding the system under study and the QC method itself.

We used Open Babel33 to generate 3D coordinates from 2D structures and to adjust the protonation state of ionizable groups to pH 7, that is, all carboxylic, phosphonic and sulfonic acid groups were deprotonated and all amino groups were protonated. For the calculation of the chemical shifts we largely follow the approach described previously.21 All molecules were subjected to a conformational search, which was conducted with the MacroModel program34 that is part of the Schrödinger suite. The OPLS 2005 force field35 was used together with an implicit solvent model for water.34 For sampling, the Monte Carlo Multiple Minimum (MCMM) algorithm was chosen36,37 with the maximum step number set to 5000. Other program options have been set to their default values or set automatically by MacroModel, which is part of the automatic setup. To avoid unphysical conformational ensembles due to the implicit solvation model, the resulting conformers were checked for intramolecular hydrogen bonds, defined by a donor (D)− acceptor (A) distance of less than 3.5 Å and a D−H−A angle of 180° ± 30°. In the case of intramolecular hydrogen bonding in at least one of the conformers, the compound was removed from the database. In addition, molecules with long carbon hydride chains were excluded, if the conformational search yielded a large number (>100) of similarly low energy structures. The conformers obtained from the conformational search were further optimized at the DFT level using the Gaussian 09 program.38 The B3LYP39 exchange correlation functional was used together with the D3 dispersion correction40 and the def2-TZVP basis set.41 In order to capture solvation effects, the conductor polarized continuum model (CPCM) was adopted using water as solvent.42,43 To ensure well-converged local minimum geometries, extremely tight convergence criteria have been used along with an ultrafine integration grid. Convergence to local minimum structures has been additionally monitored by normal-mode analysis at the same level of theory. In cases where two initially different conformers had essentially identical total energies (ΔE ≤ 10−9 hartree), it was assumed that the DFT optimization led to the same minimum structure and calculations were continued only for one of the structures.

NMR shielding constants were calculated based on the gauge-independent atomic orbitals (GIAO) approach as implemented in Gaussian 09.44−48 We calculated NMR shielding constants at the DFT level employing five different functional-basis set combinations (see Table 3). The computed NMR shielding values have been averaged according to the weights of the Boltzmann analysis. Because calculated shielding constants have been referenced to chemical shifts obtained from 1H−13C HSQC experiments, the MOSS-DFT database only contains 13C−1H pairs of covalently bonded atoms. The calculated shielding constants of methyl and methylene protons have been averaged to reduce misassignments in the case of magnetically inequivalent protons. In our calculations, about 4% of the atoms had chemical shift deviations larger than 7 and 0.6 ppm for 13C and 1H, respectively. A closer inspection of the problematic compounds suggests in some cases misassignments in the experimental spectra or obvious problems in conforma- tional sampling, such as errors in dihedral angles, especially for some tertiary carbon atoms. However, for the majority of outliers it was not easily possible to identify the specific cause for the deviation, such as less common functional groups. To prevent biased linear regression parameters, the molecules containing those atoms have been removed from the database, and the linear fit was repeated for the remaining 176 molecules.

Next, it randomly switches the order of the conformers in the list of energies, correlating the σ values of conformer j with the Boltzmann amplitude that corresponds to any other conformer k, to finally recompute the resulting DP4+ values. In other words, the shielding values corresponding to each confomer will be averaged with the amplitude computed for any other shape within the conformer set. To obtain statistically meaningful values, the procedure was iterated one million times for each candidate, although, for graphical purposes, only the first 100 iterations are shown, as this quantity is a fair representation of the overall results (Figure 2b). Despite the well-known utility of J coupling values to provide useful 3D information,8 the WJH procedure was not formulated to include such parameters.10 Hence, in this work, we focused on the study of 1H and 13C NMR shifts to faithfully emulate the script glitch. It could be argued that rebalancing the populations should have only a minor effect on the averaged ensembles whenever the conformations display low variability in their calculated shifts (as might be expected from the free rotation of simple alkyl groups).

In addition, the resonances for C-1, C-4, and C-16 were significantly high-field shifted by 1.2−3.9 ppm with respect to those in 1.

However, unlike in the case of 1, an obvious correlation of N-CH3 with H-16 was observed in the ROESY spectrum of 2, suggesting that the α-configuration of H-16 in 1 was changed to the β orientation in 2. The absolute configuration of 2 was proposed as 3R,6S,7S,13R,14R,16R,7′′S on the basis of biosynthetic considerations.

The situation is even worse in cases where only one stereoisomer is available for NMR analysis, although progress has7been made in recent years by employing statistical approaches.

The flexibility of the chain leads to experimental NMR parameters that are a weighted average from an ensemble of conformations. This severely complicates configurational analysis to the extent that standard approaches based on empirical NMR analysis3, or even recent quantum-chemical approaches using chemical-shift data10–12, are insufficient. However, combining accurate quantum-chemical prediction of the ensemble-averaged NMR parameters with analysis of encoded stereoisomeric mixtures—which were accessible through the power of iterative, reagent-controlled homologation of boronic esters (assembly-line synthesis)13—has enabled us to correct five of the seven stereogenic centres and to finally establish the correct structure of these important natural products (see below).",n,"Wu J., Lorenzo P., Zhong S., Ali M., Butts C.P., Myers E.L., Aggarwal V.K.","Synergy of synthesis, computation and NMR reveals correct baulamycin structures",2017,NATURE,"Scopus, Web of Science",

Thus, diastereomer 29 was the only structure that fitted both experimental NMR parameters simultaneously for fragment A.

Diastereomer ratios were established by gas chromatography and confirmed by 1H NMR spectroscopy. Stereochemical assignments were made using a number of methods. The tetrahydrofuran with the fused cycloheptane ring, tetrahydrofuran 20, was assigned by examination of NOE difference spectra. The structures of silyl ether products 22 and 23 were assigned by removing the silyl group to form the known diols 24 and 25, respectively (eqn (2) and (3)).25 Assigning the structure of alkene 21 with the fused oxepane ring was more difficult, however. NOE differ- ence spectra were not possible because the resonances were poorly resolved in several deuterated solvents. Because the stereoselectivity was low (and because it was similar to the ana- logous compound 23), additional derivatization experiments were not pursued. Instead, the stereochemical configuration of alkene 21 was tentatively assigned by calculating the 13C NMR chemical shifts35 of both diastereomers and comparing those values to experimentally determined ones. The carbon atom of the fused ring (C-4) gave the most distinct chemical shifts. The observed 13C chemical shift of C-4 (C6D6) for the major product (δ 83.8 ppm) is in good agreement with the calculated value of the 1,3-trans product (δ 83.1 ppm); the minor product was more consistent with the 1,3-cis product (observed at δ 81.7 compared to δ 82.4 ppm for the calculated structure).

This method begins with conformational sampling using molecular dynamics (MD), followed by quantum mechanical (QM) geometry optimization and prediction of 1H and 13C NMR chemical shifts of individual conformations. QM-based chemical shift predictions have been applied extensively to structure elucidation in natural products,21–27 and have been used to analyze the conformations of cyclic peptides.28 In the latter study, the relatively large deviations between experimental and predicted chemical shifts prompted us to develop a refined workflow in an effort to improve the accuracy of structure predictions including the ability to capture side chain rotamer populations. Here we describe a workflow that builds upon the study by Zaretsky et al.,28 but uses a different sampling approach designed to capture more subtle conformational motions, as well as a new correction procedure for addressing errors resulting from intramolecular CH–O interactions.29,30 This variant on the previously reported method, which we call conformational analysis from NMR and density-functional prediction of low-energy ensembles (CANDLE), uses high- temperature molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to generate conformer families and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to predict their 1H and 13C chemical shifts. We applied this method to the solution structure of L2N, a cyclic peptide–peptoid hybrid that we had investigated previously in a study exploring the impact of peptoid substitutions on ADME properties in cyclic peptides. CANDLE yielded more conformational information than the classic NOE- and 3J-coupling-based approach, allowing us to distinguish between two very similar b-turn types where NOE crosspeaks were inconclusive. CANDLE also allowed us to elucidate the structure of a minor conformer for which classical distance and dihedral restraints failed to yield an unambiguous structure.",y,"Nguyen Q.N.N., Schwochert J., Tantillo D.J., Lokey R.S.",Using H-1 and C-13 NMR chemical shifts to determine cyclic peptide conformations: a combined molecular dynamics and quantum mechanics approach,2018,PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY CHEMICAL PHYSICS,"Scopus, Web of Science",

Furthermore, the cal- culated NMR spectra suggest the following assignment for the peaks of 4: Ha, 7.1 ppm; Hc, 4.5 ppm; Hi, 6.4 ppm. In gratifying agreement with our experimental NMR measurements, the cal- culated NMR spectrum of 1 shows the diagnostic signal of Hj at 4.75 ppm.

The fragments included a bromoindole, a bromopyrrole and an iodo-substituted oxazole ring.1 However, assembling the molecular structure was daunting due to the multiple permutational possibilities of the iodo-substituted oxazole. The position of the iodo-substitution was inferred from the 5′′-brominated des-iodo analog, breitfussin B (see Fig. S1† for structure), using HMBC correlations semi-qualitatively to differentiate 3JCH and 2/4JCH correlations. The general problem with proton-deficient molecules is the difficulty of ruling out the existence of an unconsidered structure that satisfies the sparse and thus insufficient data constraints better than the suggested structure.13 Consequently, the proposed structures of breitfussins A and B were supported by CASE and GIAO-DFT chemical shift calculations, with experimental confirmation provided by novel, state-of-the-art Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) technology.1,2,10,14",y,"Ndukwe I.E., Lam Y.-H., Pandey S.K., Haug B.E., Bayer A., Sherer E.C., Blinov K.A., Williamson R.T., Isaksson J., Reibarkh M., Liu Y., Martin G.E.",Unequivocal structure confirmation of a breitfussin analog by anisotropic NMR measurements,2020,CHEMICAL SCIENCE,"Scopus, Web of Science",

Its molecular formula was determined as C17H14O6Cl from HRESIMS (found m/z 349.0457 [M + H]+, calcd. 349.0473). The presence of one chlorine atom in the molecule was consistent with the relative abundance of the [M + H + 2]+ peak with respect to the pseudomolecular ion [M + H]+ in the HRESIMS (Fig. 18 S, Supporting Information). The 1H and 13C spectra (l"" Table 1) re- vealed the presence of two conjugated ketone carbonyls, one methyl, one methylene, and one secondary carbinol groups; in addition, 12 aromatic carbons (three of which were protonated) were observed. These spectroscopic features suggested that 7 had the same anthraquinone skeleton as found in nalgiolaxin [19, 20]. The position of substituents on the anthraquinone core was ini- tially established by the analysis of 2D NMR spectra (l"" Table 1 and Figs. 11 S–14 S, Supporting Information). In addition, to con- firm the position of the chlorine atom along the antraquinone core, calculations of 1H chemical shifts were performed using the density functional theory (DFT) at the B3LYP/6–311+G(2 d,p) level. The calculated data were next compared with the experi- mental parameters, and according to the results (Table 3S, Supporting Information), the Boltzmann-weighted 1H chemical shifts calculated for the S enantiomer were in agreement with the proposed planar structure of 7 since the mean absolute error (MAE) value was < 0.10 ppm [21, 22]. The absolute configuration at C-2′ was established by means of optical rotation calculations at the B3LYP/DGDZVP level of the two possible enantiomers (R and S). The results revealed that the absolute configuration at C-2′ was S since the experimental optical rotation value ([α]2D0 + 51.5, c 0.007, MeOH) matched with the calculated value for the S enantiomer ([α]D + 48.4, MeOH), and the sign of the optical rota- tion reported for the dechloro derivative (+)-2′S-isorhodoptilo- metrin [23].

As con- formational interconversion is generally rapid on the NMR timescale, the observed chemical shift will be a weighted average over all of the individual conformations. NMR calculations for individual conforma- tions must be performed separately, and the chemical shifts averaged to produce an ensemble average value for each position. Assuming a thermal equilibrium between the conformers, the Boltzmann weight- ing factors for each conformer (wi) can be obtained from the relative Gibbs energies (Eq. (6.3)) The sum of the Boltzmann-weighted shielding tensors obtained sepa- rately for each conformation is then comparable to the experimental, time-averaged value. In practice, it is often expedient to assume that the entropy and volume associated with each conformation is effec- tively identical, because this enables relative energies to be used in Eq. (6.3) (rather than Gibbs energies) and avoids the need to perform several frequency calculations. For molecules with only a handful of conformations, it may be feasible to manually optimize and perform the NMR calculations. In more flexible cases, this may be a more daunting proposition and it will become desirable to automate the task of conformational searching (see Chapter 5): this is possible using numerous programs, although inevitably an inexpensive com- putational method (e.g., MM) must be used. The low-energy con- formations are selected and reoptimized at a higher level of theory or may be used directly to compute shielding tensors.

The low-energy structures within 10 kJ /mol of the global energy minimum (a larger window of 20kJ/mol was used in testing and did not result in any improvement in the results) were reoptimized with DFT (in this case with wB97XD/6-31G(d)).

In this scenario, the single point energy obtained from the DFT computation of the shielding tensor was used to generate the Boltzmann factor for conformational averaging. For the 2,800 low-energy conformations, the cost of DFT optimizations and NMR calculations was 18,500 CPU hours vs. 3,800 CPU hours when omitting the DFT optimizations. The results from both approaches were qualitatively similar, and both predicted the correct identity of the natural product on the basis of 13C calculations. However, the range between best and worst structures was smaller for the MM structures, indicating that the structural assignment of laurefurenyne (Fig. 6.2) could not be made with the same confidence as from DFT optimizations.

Its infrared (IR) spectrum exhibited absorption bands of carbonyl (1747 and 1732 cm−1) functionalities. Its high-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) data (supplemental Figure 4S) showed a deprotonated molecular ion [M − H]− at m/z 178.0152, which together with 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data are consistent with a molecular formula of C8H5NO4. Seven degrees of unsaturation were thus assigned for 1. The 1H NMR spectrum of 1 in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-d 6 (supplemental Figure 9S) indicated the resonances at δ H 7.25 (dd, J = 2.0, 7.5 Hz, H-5), 7.19 (dd, J = 7.5, 8.0 Hz, H-6), and 7.24 (dd, J = 1.5, 8.0 Hz, H-7), and 2 exchangeable protons at δ H 11.97 (br. s) and 10.42 (br. s). The presence of the 2 exchangeable protons was confirmed by the 1H NMR spectrum of 1 in deuterated methanol (CD3OD) (supplemetal Figure 5S) in which the resonances of these 2 exchangeable protons were not observed. Analysis of the 13C NMR (supplemental Figures 6S and 10S) with the aid of heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra (supplemental Figure 7S) revealed the presence of 8 sp2 carbon resonances, including 3 methines and 5 quaternary carbons. This observation suggested the presence of a 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring. The assignment of carbon signals corresponding to each proton signal was achieved by an HSQC experiment(Table 1). In the heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) spectrum of 1 (supplemental Figures 8S and 11S), the presence of the 1,2,3-trisubstituted benzene ring was confirmed by cross-peaks of H-7 (δ H 7.24) with C-3a (δ C 142.5) and C-7a (δ C 145.0) and H-5 (δ H 7.25) with C-4 (δ C 115.6) and C-3a. The carbonyl C-8 at (δ C 161.6) was linked to C-4 of the benzene ring by its HMBC correlation with H-5 (Figure 2). Taking into account the molecular formula of C8H5NO4 was established above, 4 possible structures 1, 1a, 1b, or 1c could be suggested for 1 (Figure 3). Since the 2 exchangeable broad singlet protons had no correlation in the HMBC spectrum, the structural assignment of 1 could not be resolved by 2D NMR data. Comparison of the NMR data of 1 with that previously reported for 1a 8 indicated significant differences, especially for the carbon chemical shifts of C-3a (δ C 142.5 for 1 and 133.0 for 1b), C-2 (δ C 147.2 for 1 and 156.7 for 1b) and C-8 (δ C 161.6 for 1 and 167.8 for 1b). The carbon chemical shifts of four structures 1, 1a, 1b, and 1c were calculated by using the Gaussian 09 program.9 To obtain minimum energy conformers, geometry optimization of each possible isomer of these compounds was conducted (supplemental Figures 1S-4S, supplemental Tables 1S-4S). The NMR data of compounds 1, 1a, 1b and 1c were generated by using the density functional theory method at the B3LYP/6–31G*(2d,p) level.10 The carbon chemical shift differences between experimental values of 1 with those of calculated by theory in methanol of 1, 1a, 1b, and 1c (Δδ exp – δ calcd) were presented in Table 2. These values of the aromatic carbons linking to nitrogen, C-3a (for 1a), and C-7a (for 1b) were largely different comparing to experimental chemical shifts of 1, 11.2 and 18.9 ppm, respectively. The significant difference was noted for C-2 (Δδ exp – δ calcd: −7.0), C-5 (Δδ exp – δ calcd: −8.4), and C-7 (Δδ exp – δ calcd: +8.7) of 1c (supplemental Table 8S). Whereas the calculated chemical shifts of 1 were close to the experimental values (Table 2 and supplemental Table S5). Additionally, chemical shifts difference between C-3a and C-7a for 1 was around 2.3 ppm (Table 1), while this value was 11.0 (for 1a) and 11.7 ppm (for 1b) by theory calculation (supplemental Tables 6S and 7S). This analysis allowed determining the structure of 1 as 1,3-benzodioxole-2-one-4-carboxylamide. The 2 exchangeable NH2 protons had different chemical shifts at δ H 11.97 and 10.42, probably due to hydrogen bonding of 1 proton of NH2 group with the oxygen at the position 3 making these 2 NH2 protons inequivalent. This was supported by a conformational calculation of 1 which indicated 1 proton of NH2 group was oriented toward the oxygen O-3 in the structure of the most stable conformer (94.1%) (supplemental Figure 1S and Table 1S). The calculated carbon chemical shifts of compound 1a (supplemental Table 5S) were in good agreement with those reported in the literature.8",n,"Phi Thi D., Doan Thi Mai H., Cao D.D., Vu Thi Q., Nguyen M.A., Le Thi H.M., Tran D.T., Chau V.M., Pham V.C.","Novel 1,3-Benzodioxole From Marine-Derived Actinomycete in East Vietnam Sea",2020,NATURAL PRODUCT COMMUNICATIONS,"Scopus, Web of Science",

It has already been demonstrated that heuristic/empirical approaches for chemical shift predictions are generally of low accuracy compared to quantum chemical calculation-based meth- ods (e.g. DFT) [83, 104, 105]. For DFT approaches, the factors that significantly affect the accuracy of predicted 13C and/or 1H NMR chemical shifts are the optimization level of molecular geometry [106–108], the use of differ- ent DFT theories [109–112], implicit and explicit solva- tion models [113–115], unique molecular properties of metabolites [116–121], etc. Agreement between pre- dicted and experimental chemical shifts can be improved when (i) the basis set is enlarged [104, 122], (ii) the qual- ity of the method is improved for geometry optimization [123, 124], (iii) a scaling procedure is employed [125, 126], (iv) conformational sampling is applied [127], and (v) solvation is taken into account appropriately [128, 129].

ISiCLE is an automated pipeline for high-accuracy chemical property calcula- tion, implemented using the Snakemake workflow man- agement system [132]. This pipeline takes SMILES [133] (a line notation representation of molecule structure) as input, generates initial 3D molecular conformations, and subsequently optimizes this initial structure and calcu- lates chemical properties through quantum chemistry via NWChem [134] (an open-source, high-performance computational chemistry software developed at PNNL). For this study, all molecules were initially optimized in solvent using the computationally inexpensive B3LYP [135, 136] with 3-21G basis set [137–139]. We chose this level of theory due to our available computational resources, particularly considering the treatments for the geometry optimization of over 11 k molecules. It is known that the 3-21G basis set for geometry optimization is not adequate to obtain high accuracy in NMR chemical shift calculations [127, 140, 141], but in this study it is only used to simulate NMR spectral data in order to obtain a reasonable representative distribution of (likely moderate accuracy) chemical shifts. Assessment of the best compu- tational approaches to maximize accuracy of NMR chem- ical shift calculations is beyond the scope of this study. To test whether the NMR spectral data is statistically affected or not by using any other DFT method, the isotropic shielding values of 5 randomly chosen molecules in dif- ferent shapes and sizes from Sets I and II were calculated using 3 different DFT methods. The shielding values were observed to be shifted in the same direction following the same pattern. Further details are given in Additional file 2. The inclusion of solvent is via the COnductor-like Screening MOdel (COSMO) [142] solvation modeling. NMR isotropic shieldings were calculated for all opti- mized molecules at the B3LYP/cc-pVDZ [139, 143] level of theory. Based on our previous assessment [131], this method provides reliable chemical shifts [112] and yields isotropic shieldings with a reasonably low computational cost [144].

Unique conformations were identified manually based on the C-2-Me, C-2, C-9, C-9-Me dihedral angles, and potential energy recorded following each cycle. Up to 20 conformations for each stereoisomer were removed for geometric optimization and frequency calculations using the B3LYP functional with a 6–31+G(d,p) basis set [61].

[16,17], and compared their quality by the literature proposed error function MAE [1]. The results are presented in Figure 8. Therefore, the structural quality of the conformers of L or [Zn(L)2]2+ were mainly limited by the quality of the r2SCAN-3c//def2-mTZVPP level of DFT theory [17] and their free-energy values were limited by the quality of computational theory levels of each of the free-energy components that were calculated (electron energy, mRHHO contribution and solvation contribution). Perhaps the most important limitation defining the quality of the calculated NMR parameters was the quality of the DFT theory level by which these parameters were calculated (PBE0-d4/def2-TZVP level, see Section 2.2.3). Having in mind all these possible sources of errors in calculation, Figure 8 suggests that the most likely structurally correct models of L or [Zn(L)2]2+ have MAE(conf) values below cca 0.1 ppm for 1H and below cca 1 ppm for 13C shifts. As such small values were also obtained for Boltzmann weighted ensembles of L or [Zn(L)2]2+ (Figure 3), we can conclude that these numbers are the limitations of theory levels used in computation. For complex [Zn(L)2]2+, for which three low-lying energy conformers were obtained during generation of conformer ensembles (steps 1 and 2 of the computational procedure, see Section 2.2.2 and Section 2.2.3), the conformer with the lowest MAE(conf) value was the expected mer- C2 symmetric isomer, also in agreement with the 2D NOESY NMR measurement and with X-ray crystallography. On the other hand, for the more flexible ligand L, we obtained better MAE(conf) agreements with a conformer that was not ranged as the most stable one, but for one with almost identical calculated free energy value (conformer 2). The MAE(conf) values for this conformer were even lower than for the Boltzmann averaged values [MAE(Boltz], Figure 3). It is hard to rationalize whether this deviation came from limitations of the free-energy or of the NMR properties calculation procedures (DFT theory levels).",n,"Periƒá B., Pantalon Juraj N., ≈†tefaniƒá Z., Kirin S.I.","Structural Determination of the Hexacoordinated [Zn(L)(2)](2+) Complex Isomer Type Using Solution-State NMR, DFT Calculations and X-ray Crystallography",2023,CRYSTALS,"Scopus, Web of Science",

Among the possible tools, density functional theory (DFT) [19] has reached an enormous popularity and a number of reviews have been published over the last years [20–26]. Density functional theory is a theory of the electronic structure based on the electron density ρ(r) rather than the many-electron wavefunction and allows to determine the properties of a system using a functional dependent only on ρ(r) with relatively short computational times. With an appropriate choice of the functional and basis set it is possible to perform calculations on large molecules with high efficiency. Up to now, unfortunately, for most of systems there are no rules to choose the correct DFT protocol to obtain the best agreement with the experimental data: an efficient functional is fundamental but it depends on the molecular/spectroscopic properties and on the metal under examination, the basis set must be large enough and include—if necessary—polarization and diffuse functions and relativistic effects, and in some cases the role of the solvent must be considered through continuum solvation models such as polarizable continuum model (PCM) [27] or solvation model based on density (SMD) [28]. Therefore, on the basis of the actual knowledge in the literature, the best protocol for a DFT calculation must be obtained case by case, and a criterion to establish which level of theory will give the best agreement with the experiment under consideration is lacking. Density functional theory methods allows to calculate the structure, energy, and molecular properties with great accuracy. Concerning the spectroscopic behavior of the transition metal ions, IR, UV-vis, CD, and magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectra were simulated, but only for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and EPR—and UV-Vis in some rare cases [29]—the agreement with the experimental data can be quantitative [30–37].",y,"Sciortino G., Lubinu G., Mar√©chal J.-D., Garribba E.",DFT Protocol for EPR Prediction of Paramagnetic Cu(II) Complexes and Application to Protein Binding Sites,2018,MAGNETOCHEMISTRY,"Scopus, Web of Science",

After more than a cen- tury of development, a wide variety of hit compounds are still being isolated from natural sources [1]. Thanks to the continuous advancement of chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques, scientists are able to explore minor and/or complex components. In recent years, the application of quantum chemical calculations has facilitated accurate, high-speed, theoretical methods to predict 2D and 3D molecular structures [2]. Reliable methods were established and optimized to compute NMR chemical shifts and coupling constants with minimal computational cost [2,3]. Regarding 3D structural identification, a breakthrough was first made by the Goodman group, introducing the CP3 parameters in 2009, followed by the DP4 probabilistic method in 2010 [4,5]. While the application of the former method is limited, the latter was successfully applied in many cases to confirm or correct the relative configuration of natural products of varying complexity [6–8]. More recently, the Sarotti group introduced two modified probabilistic methods based on the mathematical core of the DP4 probability: DP4+ and J-DP4 [9,10]. Many successful applications of the DP4+ probability method have already been reported in the field of natural products [7,11]. Most recently, the DP5 method was published by the Goodman group in 2022 [12]. Nonetheless, the computational effort associated with these methods can be significant, especially in the case of large and flexible molecules. In order to reduce this large workload, several (semi-)automatic procedures were developed, using freely accessible programming lan- guages (Python, Bash and R), Excel (DP4+ and J-DP4 templates), machine learning and deep learning [9,13,14]. Software applications implementing Computer-Assisted 3D Struc- ture Elucidation (CASE-3D) were also developed recently, such as the StereoFitter from Mestrelab MNova, CMC-se from Bruker, Structure Elucidator from ACD labs and Logic Structure Determination (LSD) from Nuzillard and Plainchont [15–18].

Often, a single 1H,13C-HSQC experiment was sufficient for complete assignment of 13C NMR data. In order to calibrate the data for comparison, for each atom an average ([Graphic 7]) of corresponding chemical shifts in four diastereomers is calculated. Then differences (Δi) between these averages and individual chemical shifts are calculated (Equation 1). The same approach is followed for calculated isotropic shieldings. In case of the latter a change of sign is necessary since shieldings are negatively proportional to shifts (Equation 2). This way listings of directly comparable Δi data are created.

A set of four low-energy conformers with relative energies within a 10 kJ mol–1 window were identified for each of the two 1,2-dioxolanes [(Ε)-13 and (Ε,Ε)-14]. The energies and optimal geometries of all conformers were then determined at a higher level of theory, using the M06-2X density functional with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set, and implicit solvation in CHCl (IEFPCM; integral equation formalism variant of the polarizable continuum model), as implemented in Gaussian 09 software package (Revision A.02).56 Solute cavities were constructed using default united-atom radii (UA0). A pruned (99,590) integration grid (99 radial shells and 590 angular points per shell; “ultrafine” grid in Gaussian 09) and very tight geometrical convergence criteria were employed. All optimized structures were verified as ground-state minima by performing frequency calculations at the same level of theory (no imaginary frequencies were found), the data from which were also used to compute their Boltzmann distribution at 298 K. The first most stable conformers of (Ε)-13 and (Ε,Ε)-14, accounting for overall 82.3% and 90.0% population, respectively, at 298 K, are shown in Figure 1, while all four low-energy conformers of each compound are shown in Figures S12–S13 in the Supporting Information. All optimized structures were then used for NMR calculations. NMR shielding tensors (σ, in ppm) were computed with the gauge- independent atomic orbitals (GIAO) method at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level of theory, including chloroform solvation effects (using the IEFPCM solvation model), while employing solute cavities built from Bondi radii as implemented in Gaussian 09. A pruned (99,590) integration grid was employed. The computed isotropic magnetic shielding tensors (σiso, in ppm) for each nucleus in all conformers was converted to referenced and empirically scaled chemical shifts (δscaled, in ppm) by applying scaling and referencing factors (slope and intercept, respectively) according to the equation: δscaled = (σiso – intercept) / slope, where δscaled is the referenced/scaled chemical shift (in ppm), and σiso is the isotropic computed NMR shielding tensor (in ppm). The slope and intercept values are typically obtained by linear regression analysis of a plot of the calculated isotropic magnetic shielding tensors (σiso) against the corresponding experimental chemical shifts (δexpt). In the present study, we used generic-scaling factors obtained from large datasets [i.e. obtained from linear regression analysis of a plot of calculated isotropic magnetic shielding tensors (σiso) against experimental chemical shifts (δexpt) of a large series of compounds]; these scaling/referencing factors are specific of the level of theory used. For the level of theory used herein [B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p)//M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p)] the following values have been calculated by Willoughby et al., 51: for 1H: intercept = 31.9477, slope = –1.0767; for 13C: intercept = 181.2412, slope = -1.0522. The final calculated chemical shift values (δcalcd, in ppm; Table 1) were determined by Boltzmann averaging the scaled chemical shift values (δscaled, in ppm), based on the calculated Gibbs free energy values of each conformer. Specifically, by using the free energy data (kcal mol–1) obtained from the frequency calculations, a Boltzmann weighting factor [e(–E/RT), where E is the relative energy (kcal mol–1) with respect to the most stable conformer, T is the temperature (in K), and R is the gas constant (0.001986 kcal mol–1 K-1)] was determined for each conformer at 298 K, which was, in turn, converted into the relative mole fraction by dividing the calculated Boltzmann factor of each conformer by the sum of all the Boltzmann factors of all contributing conformers. The resulting weighting factors (mole fraction contributions) were applied to the scaled chemical shift values (δscaled, in ppm) for each nucleus of each individual conformer. Summation of the weighted chemical shifts across all conformers generates the final Boltzmann-weighted average chemical shifts (δcalcd, in ppm) used to compare against experimental data (δexpt, in ppm; Table 1). The computed 1H chemical shifts of each methyl group were arithmetically averaged due to their conformational freedom (i.e. free rotation at 298 K), while the calculated chemical shifts of the H and C atoms of the two phenyl rings were not included in the comparison, since the corresponding experimental chemical shifts could not be unambiguously assigned (however, it should be noted that comparison of all chemical shifts data –including tentatively assigned experimental chemical shifts for the phenyl H and C atoms– was again in very good agreement with the calculated values).",n,"Tzirakis M.D., Alberti M.N.","On the mechanism of the [4+2] cycloaddition of O-1(2) with 1,3-dienes: Identifying the putative biradical/dipolar intermediate by employing the gem-diphenylcyclopropylcarbinyl radical clock as a mechanistic probe",2015,ARKIVOC,"Scopus, Web of Science",
283,285,10.4155/bio-2015-0004,y,y,n,n,,86,1,[86],"2D NMR spectroscopy has been used for the char- acterization of the backbone topologies of unknown molecules in metabolomics samples toward the eluci- dation of metabolite structures in complex mixtures. In this way, it was possible to identify 112 individual carbon backbone topologies from a single E. coli cell lysate [81]. In a parallel development, MS of metabolite mixtures has made important inroads in recent years, providing information that is highly complementary to the one derived from NMR. With increasing resolu- tion of mass spectrometers, such as Q-TOF, orbitrap, and FT-ICR, the determination of ‘accurate masses’ of individual metabolites is becoming increasingly routine. This information allows one to deduce the molecular formula of metabolites that underlies each peak in the mass spectrum. However, it is a long way from the knowledge of molecular formulas to the iden- tification of individual molecules, because of the large degeneracy of the structural space (manifold) belong- ing to a given accurate mass. For example, according to the ChemSpider database [82,83], there are 999 different molecules that have the same mass as tyrosine. With increasing mass, this degeneracy increases exponen- tially. The mass spectrometric solution to this problem is the measurement of MS/MS spectra of molecular fragments, provided that they are unique for each mol- ecule. However, since fragmentation cannot be accu- rately predicted, this requires the compilation of MS/ MS databases, such as METLIN [84,85], using experi- mental fragmentation data of individual metabolites. This makes the identification of unknown (i.e., uncat- aloged) metabolites very challenging by MS alone. By contrast, NMR spectroscopic data can be predicted with reasonable accuracy for a given metabolite struc- ture [86]. NMR chemical shifts are particularly suit- able, since they are very sensitive to the nature of the local chemical bonding and hence the chemical shifts will significantly change between most isobaric iso- mers. Because most metabolites have multiple nuclear spins and, hence, multiple chemical shifts, the overall agreement between experimentally determined chemi- cal shifts and predicted chemical shifts provides an effective filter to identify those metabolites that best fit the experimental data.",n,"Bingol K., Bruschweiler-Li L., Li D., Zhang B., Xie M., Br√ºschweiler R.",Emerging new strategies for successful metabolite identification in metabolomics,2016,BIOANALYSIS,"Scopus, Web of Science",
